- **Ring_FD** is an implementation of failure detection based on ring topology.

- **RT_FD** is an implementation of failure detection based on Ring-Tree topology.

- **RB_FD** is an implementation of failure detection based on Ring-Butterfly topology.

- **FT_CC** is fault-tolerant collective communications.

- The **"jacobi"** folder contains all implementations of the Jacobi iterations experiment. Experiments include general parallelism and block parallelism, fault-tolerant and non-fault-tolerant.
